# Riley Inc. Customer Case Studies

## PawPal Veterinary Network
**Industry:** Veterinary Services  
**Challenge:** PawPal operated 63 clinics across the Pacific Northwest but struggled to maintain consistent care plans and compliance documentation. Their legacy AI triage assistant experienced hallucinations during late-night surges, resulting in delayed treatment recommendations.  
**Solution:** Riley Inc. deployed SnoutSuite's Evaluations-as-a-Service offering, calibrating prompt templates against PawPal's clinical protocols. A PackCollab workshop designed scenario-specific guardrails, while TreatToss Hubs gathered recovery data for post-operative pets.  
**Impact:** Within three months, PawPal reduced triage review time by 35%, improved documentation completeness to 98%, and cut malpractice exposure premiums by $420K annually.

## Emberlane Retail Group
**Industry:** Specialty Retail  
**Challenge:** Emberlane needed a conversational commerce agent that could handle regional dialects and seasonal promotions without veering off-brand. Previous LLM experiments produced inconsistent discounting behavior and inaccurate inventory lookups.  
**Solution:** Riley Inc.'s Cloud Advisory team migrated Emberlane workflows into AWS, introducing the SnoutSuite PawPrint Monitor and custom multilingual evaluators. Advisory consultants integrated SnoutSuite telemetry with Emberlane's pricing engine via event-driven Lambda functions.  
**Impact:** Conversion rates rose 22% in the first holiday season post-launch, average handle time dropped by 41 seconds, and stockout incidents declined 18% due to real-time evaluation feedback loops.

## MetroLoop Transit Authority
**Industry:** Public Sector Transportation  
**Challenge:** MetroLoop aimed to pilot AI-powered rider assistance kiosks but faced strict accessibility standards and transparency requirements. The authority needed assurance that multilingual guidance would remain reliable during service disruptions.  
**Solution:** Riley Inc. orchestrated a two-phase engagement: SnoutSuite's Compliance Kennel generated model documentation aligned to city ordinance 18.4B, while CorgiLink sensors collected ambient noise data to stress-test responses. The Innovation Lab co-designed an explainability widget for kiosk displays.  
**Impact:** MetroLoop achieved 99.2% ADA compliance in evaluations, deflected 62% of station agent inquiries during beta testing, and reported a 14-point increase in rider satisfaction among non-English speakers.

## Harborstone Insurance
**Industry:** Financial Services  
**Challenge:** Harborstone underwriters relied on manual policy reviews, leading to inconsistent risk assessments and elongated quote cycles. Prior automation attempts failed regulatory audits around fairness.  
**Solution:** Riley Inc. implemented SnoutSuite fairness scorecards tied to Harborstone's actuarial guidelines. The customer success team hosted a "Bias Breakdown" series to interpret evaluation metrics, and TreatToss Edge devices piloted telematics data ingestion for pet insurance lines.  
**Impact:** Policy issuance turnaround shrank from 10 days to 48 hours, fairness deviations fell below 1.5% across protected classes, and cross-sell revenue grew by $3.1M quarter-over-quarter.

## Nimbly Studios
**Industry:** Media & Entertainment  
**Challenge:** Nimbly sought AI-driven storyboarding assistants for global animation teams but feared leaks of pre-release scripts. They required a secure, collaborative evaluation space to vet generative models without risking IP exposure.  
**Solution:** Riley Inc. provisioned an isolated SnoutSuite tenant with private key management, integrated zero-knowledge logging through the Pawsitive Ledger pilot, and trained creative directors on PackCollab annotation workflows.  
**Impact:** Nimbly condensed storyboarding cycles by 47%, saw a 30% reduction in revision rounds, and maintained zero security incidents during the six-month production sprint.
