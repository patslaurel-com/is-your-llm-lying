# Riley Inc. Product Portfolio

## SnoutSuite Platform
SnoutSuite is Riley Inc.'s flagship evaluation and observability platform designed for regulated AI deployments. Core capabilities include baseline benchmarking, hallucination heatmaps, fairness scorecards, and automated regression testing for large language models. Customers configure guardrails through a visual policy builder, while the "Treat Tracker" pipeline aggregates prompt-response telemetry and flags anomalies in near real time. SnoutSuite integrates with AWS Bedrock, SageMaker, and on-premises inference hubs through prebuilt connectors.

### Key Modules
- **PawPrint Drift Monitor:** Detects shifts in prompt distributions, model embeddings, and output sentiment, enabling proactive retraining.
- **Compliance Kennel:** Generates audit-ready dossiers with lineage, dataset provenance, and evaluation results mapped to emerging regulations.
- **PackCollab Workspace:** Facilitates asynchronous review of evaluation artifacts, allowing cross-functional teams to annotate outputs and propose remediation playbooks.

## Connected Pet Devices
Riley Inc. extends SnoutSuite insights into the physical world with a growing line of smart devices:
- **CorgiLink Collar:** Captures biometric data and syncs with SnoutSuite to personalize wellness recommendations for pets.
- **TreatToss Hub:** An IoT dispenser that uses reinforcement learning to schedule enrichment activities based on pet behavior and owner preferences.
- **SleepyPaws Mat:** Monitors rest patterns, integrates with AWS IoT Core, and triggers alerts when anomalies may indicate stress.
Each device ships with a secure firmware stack hardened through the company's PawSec initiative, ensuring compliance with veterinary data standards.

## Advisory and Enablement Services
Riley Inc.'s Cloud Advisory practice complements the product suite with:
- Migration accelerators for customers moving LLM workloads into AWS.

## Innovation Roadmap
Upcoming releases emphasize openness and ecosystem growth:
1. **SnoutSuite SDK 2.0:** A Python toolkit that allows customers to design custom evaluators, integrate proprietary datasets, and publish shareable evaluation blueprints.
2. **Pawsitive ID:** Identity and access management for cross-organization collaboration, leveraging short-lived credentials and zero trust principles.
3. **TreatToss Edge:** A hardware refresh featuring edge inference chips that support offline reinforcement learning for animal shelters with limited connectivity.

## Customer Success Snapshots
- **Happy Trails Veterinary Group:** Leveraged SnoutSuite and CorgiLink data to reduce post-operative complications by 18% while automating compliance documentation.
- **Trailblaze Outfitters:** An outdoor apparel brand that applied PackCollab workflows to fine-tune marketing chatbots, yielding a 24% lift in customer satisfaction scores.
