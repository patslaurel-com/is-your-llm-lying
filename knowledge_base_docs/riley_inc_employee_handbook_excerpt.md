# Riley Inc. Employee Handbook Excerpt

## Welcome from Riley the Corgi
"Every teammate deserves a safe space to chase big ideas and bring their whole self to work." — Riley the Corgi, CEO. Riley Inc. operates on trust, curiosity, and a bias toward playful experimentation. This excerpt covers the core values, policies, and benefits that support our global pack.

## Core Values
1. **Lead with Pawsitivity:** Assume good intent, provide constructive feedback, and look for opportunities to uplift teammates and customers.
2. **Fetch Real Outcomes:** Measure impact, celebrate data-driven decisions, and own the business results of your work.
3. **Guard the Pack:** Uphold privacy commitments, secure customer data, and practice psychological safety in every interaction.

## Work Model and Hours
Riley Inc. is a hybrid-remote organization. Employees select one of three modes each quarter: Remote-First, Hub-Flex (2-3 days in a Riley hub), or On-Site Core (4-5 days). Core collaboration hours are 10:00–15:00 Pacific Time to balance global time zones. Team rituals include Monday "Tail Wag" kickoffs and Friday demo days where squads showcase experiments or customer wins.

## Benefits Snapshot
- **Healthcare:** Comprehensive medical, dental, and vision coverage starting day one; pet insurance stipends for up to two animals per household.
- **Time Off:** 20 days of paid time off (PTO), 10 company holidays, and two annual "Sniffari" weeks reserved for exploration and learning.
- **Wellness:** Quarterly wellness allowance, access to dog-friendly coworking spaces, and mental health support through the CalmPaws program.
- **Learning & Development:** Annual $2,500 learning budget, access to SnoutSuite Academy, and mentorship cafes hosted by senior leaders.

## Performance Philosophy
We evaluate impact through the "OKR + Bark" framework. Each team sets quarterly objectives and key results, accompanied by a Bark: an aspirational, customer-centric statement that frames why the work matters. Formal check-ins occur mid-quarter and end-of-quarter, with constant informal feedback encouraged. Promotions follow a calibration process that considers competencies, scope, and embodiment of core values.

## Ethics and Compliance
- **Data Stewardship:** All employees must complete annual secure coding and privacy training. Sensitive datasets may only be accessed via approved workspaces with multifactor authentication.
- **AI Responsibility Charter:** Team members document model lineage, evaluation results, and remediation steps before any production deployment. Violations are escalated to the Responsible AI Council chaired by Riley the Corgi.
- **Speak-Up Policy:** Riley Inc. maintains anonymous reporting channels and zero tolerance for retaliation. Concerns are reviewed within 48 hours by the Ethics Committee.

## Community Engagement
Every quarter, squads participate in "Pack Service" days supporting animal shelters, STEM education, or environmental causes. Employees receive eight hours of paid volunteer time per month and matching donations up to $1,000 annually to charities aligned with the Pawsitive Impact mission.

Employees can find detailed policies, travel guidelines, and benefits enrollment information on the PackPortal intranet. For questions, reach out to peopleops@riley.inc or visit the HR BarkDesk channel in Slack.
